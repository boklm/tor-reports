The main things I have done in November:

- added support for arch migration in the update_responses script[1]

- started an experiment to automatically rebase tor browser patches on
  gecko-dev master branch[2][3]. It still needs a few improvements before
  we run it automatically every day and notify of new patches that fail
  to apply.

- fixed a few problems in the tbb testsuite to make it run on Windows
  using cygwin.

- worked with Arlo and Sukhbir on Tor Messenger build. While working on
  a Windows build, I made a patch to fix some mingw cross compile issues
  on mozilla-central[4], which has also been fixed upstream by someone
  else at the same time[5]. Fixed some other build issues on comm-central[6][7].

- we need a new person for French support (Lunar who has been doing that
  until now will be away for a while) but we don't have one yet so I
  took over answering french helpdesk emails in the interim.
