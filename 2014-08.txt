The main things I have done in August:

- made a script to generate responses for the new TBB updater (#12622).

- improved the test reports index page[1]

- added support for running mochitests included in the tor-browser
  sources tree.

- made it possible to ignore some test failures for known issues[2].

- added a test suggested in the iSEC partners' report to enumerate
  exposed DOM objects[3]. It still needs to be improved to enumerate them
  recursively (#13094).
