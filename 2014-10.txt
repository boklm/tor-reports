The main things I have done in October:

- added support for the generation of incremental mar files in
  update_responses script: #13324

- worked on a patch to use git tags to set tor browser version: #13015

- launched rebuild and unit tests on all tor-browser esr31.2 commits[1]

- fixed and improved virustotal uploads[2]

- worked with Arlo and Sukhbir to automate Tor Messenger build process[3]
  so we can have nightly builds. We now have linux i686 and x86_64 builds.
  Windows and OS X builds should be comming soon.
